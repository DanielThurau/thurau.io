                My friend Matthew Wheeler had been in a four month training 
                program in Arizona as an officer in the Army Reserves. I had 
                just started a sabbatical from my job at Amazon when I got a 
                message that he finished his course and needed to drive his car 
                back to Washington D.C. He proposed a road trip through the U.S. 
                hitting a few national parks along the way. We decided to do as 
                little planning as possible and to ‚ÄúDo It Live‚Äù, so I booked a 
                flight, packed my bags and jumped on a plane to Phoenix.
