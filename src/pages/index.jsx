          <p>
            I'm a former Amazonian and a Univeristy of California: Santa Cruz alumni with a
            BS in Computer Science. I currently live in San Francisco and work on cool projects
            (including this website). I also try to read a lot.

          <p>
            Some of those projects will be releasing on this very website, so keep and eye out!
